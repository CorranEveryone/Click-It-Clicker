# Compiling into a .sb3
This project runs in turbowarp so you should take a .sb3 and your good. Well, I couldn't upload the complete project as it got to big so github wouldn't allow me to upload it. I will tell you how to take the files and turn it back into one.

1. Take your src folder
2. Create a new zip folder
3. Take everything from the src folder into the zip folder
4. Rename the zip folder into "The Ultamate Clicker.sb3"
